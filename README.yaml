# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision an S3 bucket for [Helm](https://helm.sh/) chart repository, and an IAM role and policy with permissions for Kops nodes to access the bucket.

  The module uses [terraform-aws-kops-metadata](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-kops-metadata) to lookup resources within a Kops cluster for easier integration with Terraform.
